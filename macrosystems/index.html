         <h1>Alternative Futures for the American Residential Macrosystem</h1>
         <hr>
      </div>
      <div class="main-text">
            <p>Urban, suburban and exurban land use covers an increasingly large area of the U.S. (Brown et al. 2005).
            This area of human settlements represents a macrosystem, which Heffernan et al. (2014) define as
            <em>“regional to continental extents with distances spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometers with
            biological, geophysical and social components that interact with one another and with phenomena at
            other spatial or temporal scales ranging from days to millennia.”</em> This “American Residential
            Macrosystem” has continental-scale impacts on water, energy, carbon and nutrient dynamics and the
            quality of life of human populations. Further, the large and expanding extent of this system at the interface
            with agricultural and less human-dominated systems suggests that it has broader, continental-scale
            impacts on community assembly, evolution and ecosystem response to global environmental change.</p>

            <p>In ongoing research funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Macrosystems Biology program,
            we have been investigating the American Residential Macrosystem, with a focus on “ecological
            homogenization,” the hypothesis that residential ecosystems and landscapes across the continent are
            more similar than the native ecosystems that they replaced (Groffman et al. 2014). We have
            characterized and evaluated continental-scale effects of this homogenization on plant biodiversity, soil
            carbon and nitrogen (N) pools and processes, microclimate, hydrography and land cover in six cities
            across the U.S. (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix and Los Angeles) (Groffman et
            al. 2014, Steele et al. 2014, Hall et al. 2015, Trammell et al. 2016, Wheeler et al. 2016). We have also
            determined that these effects are driven by complex and dynamic human actions at multiple spatial and
            temporal scales, e.g., parcel, neighborhood, and region (metropolitan statistical area) (Polsky et al.
            2014b, Larson et al. 2015, Groffman et al. 2016). These results suggest that the structure and function of
            the American Residential Macrosystem are subject to change over 50 – 100 year time frames with
            potentially significant continental scale effects on ecological processes and environmental quality.</p>

            <p>More broadly, our ecological analysis of the American Residential Macrosystem has suggested that
            human dynamics interact with natural processes of ecological community assembly to affect ecosystem
            structure and function not only in the dense urban core areas of cities, but also in the much larger and
            ecologically dynamic suburban lands surrounding cities (Pearse et al. 2016). These areas at the “urbanwildland
            interface” with agricultural and less human-dominated (“natural”) ecosystems are where the
            communities and ecosystems that will dominate the continent over the next 100 years are being
            assembled. Therefore, it is critical to study processes of ecological assembly, evolution and ecosystem
            function in both the human-dominated and interstitial natural areas at this interface to understand how
            these processes will interact with climate change and other components of global environmental change
            to affect macrosystem biology across the continent over the next 50 – 100 years. Hence, while our
            previous project tested the extent and mechanisms of ecological homogenization within and across cities,
            the potential for change in these processes and their interactions with non-urban land cover remain major
            uncertainties in understanding future trajectories at regional and continental scales. We therefore propose
            to address two questions:</p>

            <hr>

            <p class="lead">What factors contribute to maintenance and change in the American Residential
            Macrosystem? How resistant is the American Residential Macrosystem to change?</p>

            <hr>

            <p>We hypothesize that both biophysical (e.g.,
            plant dispersal) and social (e.g. changing regulations and preferences) drivers will create the
            potential for significant ecological change in the American Residential Macrosystem despite
            institutions, norms, values, and commercial drivers that act as stabilizing forces resisting change.</p>

            <p><strong>Experimental plan</strong></p>

            <p>Myriad ecological and social processes combine to determine the structure and functioning of yards and
            other green spaces in cities. We aim to determine how ecological factors (e.g., dispersal, climate
            constraints) interact with social factors (e.g., homeowner values, norms, institutional constraints) to
            influence community assembly and yard management and determine the dynamics of the American
            Residential Macrosystem. We will combine data on yard ecological characteristics, including patterns of
            diversity and the traits of yard species, with data from interviews with homeowners (new and existing),
            document analysis, and interviews with informants from the policy/governance, outreach/knowledge, and
            commercial sectors to understand the potential for change in the American Residential Macrosystem.</p>

            <p><strong>Understanding community assembly in yards.</strong> Urban yards are assembled by (1) human cultivation of
            species based on social factors and (2) colonization of “spontaneous” species that can disperse well and
            persist readily in urban environments (Knapp et al. 2012, Pearse et al. 2016). To understand
            the factors influencing these two processes, we will analyze plant diversity data collected in our previous
            household yard sampling (richness and composition of all species plus basal area of trees and cover of
            lawn species (Pearse et al. 2016, Wheeler et al. 2016) in new ways that are integrated with both “old”
            social survey data collected as part of the previous grant and the “new” social surveys proposed below.
            We will determine the degree to which homeowner values determined to be important in the previous
            household survey (beauty, a weed-free aesthetic, and ease of maintenance, Larson et al. 2015), along
            with additional information gathered in new social science surveys described below, predict the
            composition of the cultivated and spontaneous flora, e.g., by comparing ordinations of species with
            survey responses. To further understand the diversity and composition of the spontaneous yard flora, we
            will use the TRY Plant Trait Database to compare the traits of the spontaneous yard flora to those of the
            regional native flora to determine the importance of different filters on community assembly imposed by
            the urban environment. For example, over-representation by small-seeded, wind-dispersed species will
            indicate that animal dispersal is a significant filter on the spontaneous flora (Knapp et al. 2012). A
            predominance of bird dispersed and/or pollinated species, but few insect pollinated species, might imply
            that birds contribute to community assembly but the lack of insect pollinators imposes a filter on the
            reproduction of plant species. Inferences from plant trait composition will be corroborated by new insect
            and bird surveys. Additionally, characteristics of the spontaneous flora may reflect homeowner values and
            preferences, explaining why homeowners remove some species, but allow others to persist.</p>

            <p><strong>Understanding parcel-scale/homeowner drivers of change.</strong> To better understand household level
            factors that lead to transitions in yard management and ecological structure and function, we will evaluate
            homeowner narratives about the transitions, or stability, in their yards. These narratives center the locus
            of control at many scales (e.g., self, neighborhood, city, Dahmus and Nelson 2014a) and provide
            information about homeowners’ perceptions regarding their ability to achieve their ideal yard (Dahmus
            and Nelson 2014b). We aim to understand the factors and actors that homeowners identify as hindering
            or facilitating their attempts to change, along with their actual management behaviors and yard ecological
            characteristics, to determine the relationship between household yard transitions and ecological functions
            such as vegetation biodiversity and water use. To understand these transitions, we will conduct new
            content analyses of data from interviews/surveys collected in each of the six study regions during our
            current grant. Analysis of open-ended questions in the interview transcripts will focus on factors that
            emerge as drivers within the broad categories of constraints and facilitators of change, ideal yard
            descriptions, preferences, behaviors, homeowner knowledge networks, and subjective social norms.
            Closed-ended questions will be used to determine the influence of life stage, household demographics,
            number of years in the residence, and management criteria. Vegetation data, and pervious and
            impervious surface data collected at the household level provide distinct measures of yard ecological
            attributes. This approach will provide rich analysis of transition patterns and diversity across the six study
            cities to identify trends in yard transitions from the homeowner’s perspective and inform landscape-level
            scenario formulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Understanding institutional drivers of change.</strong> To understand how broader scale political economic
            and institutional processes contribute to change or stability in households’ landscaping practices, we will
            determine how household decision-making, landscaping knowledge, and sociocultural norms are shaped
            by institutional processes. Existing conceptual models and approaches emphasize the important role that
            institutions play in influencing landscape management and change, such as vegetation and groundcover
            choices and irrigation practices (Roy Chowdhury 2011; Cook et al. 2012). Institutions are typically defined
            as the rules governing how people act and include formal rules that are codified and enforceable by law
            (i.e., through government policies, legal agreements) as well as informal rules that are embodied in
            societal norms that are enforced through social interactions and sanctions (e.g., approval or disapproval)
            (Larson and Brumand 2014). While some research has been conducted on specific institutions in single
            cities (Fraser et al. 2013, Larson and Brumand 2014, Sisser et al. 2016), cross-site analyses are needed
            to understand how municipal and broader scale institutions – both formal and informal – influence
            landscapes choices likely to cause future change.</p>

            <hr>

            <p class="lead">What are the ecological implications of alternative futures of the American Residential
            Macrosystem to community assembly and ecosystem function at parcel (ecosystem),
            landscape (city), regional (MSA) and continental scales?</p>

            <hr>

            <p>We hypothesize that management for nutrient- and water-use efficient and
            wildlife-supporting plants and lower inputs of water and nutrients will give rise to greater regional
            biodiversity across trophic levels, higher nutrient retention, lower water use and reduced runoff,
            and losses of soil carbon and nitrogen from residential yards at the regional scale.</p>

              <p><strong>Experimental plan</strong></p>

            <p>To explore the implications of alternative futures of the American Residential Macrosystem, we will
            compare the ecological outcomes of five alternative scenarios of parcel management based on our past
            research (Fissore et al. 2011, Martini et al. 2014, Larson et al. 2015). These scenarios are (a) biodiversity
            (certified wildlife), (b) high input (lawn care service), (c) average input (homeowner fertilizer), (d) no input
            (no water, no fertilizer), and (e) low impact on hydrology (e.g., rain gardens, rain barrels). We will also
            make measurements on “interstitial unmanaged vegetation” (i.e., unmanaged public lands) and natural
            reference ecosystem areas within or adjacent to each city. These experimental plot contrasts will be
            made in suburban areas, as suburbs represent a much larger area on a continental scale than urban
            areas and have high potential for interaction between yards and natural or semi-natural soil/vegetation. In
            each of our five cities, we will locate 37 experimental plots distributed as follows:<br>
            1.  Households that have adopted innovative practices or not: biodiversity (certified wildlife), high
            intensity (lawn care service), average intensity (homeowner fertilizer), passive (no water, no fertilizer),
            low impact on hydrology: 5 treatments x 5 reps = 25 yards.<br>
            2.  Areas of interstitial suburban spontaneous vegetation = 6 plots.<br>
            3.  Reference areas (larger than interstitial areas) dominated by mostly native vegetation = 6 plots.</p>

            <p>To locate “biodiversity” yards, we will work with the National Wildlife Federation which has developed a
            habitat certification program for yards and maintains a national database of certified yards. The “low
            impact on hydrology” yards will be located through municipal, watershed district or other such contacts
            overseeing installation of these features in each city. The high, medium and passive management yards
            will be chosen from the population of homeowners that expressed a willingness to work with us (via the
            phone survey) in our previous study. Areas of “interstitial spontaneous vegetation” will be chosen based
            on surveys in each city. We will establish size, shape and disturbance criteria for including these areas
            appropriate to each city. In all cities, these sites will be located (to the degree possible) on intact, natural
            soil profiles to facilitate their relevance to community assembly at the urban:wildland interface and
            beyond. Natural reference areas will be chosen from sites identified for our previous study.</p>

            <p>As was done in our previous study, we will assemble sampling teams in each city to carry out vegetation,
            soil, bird, insect and water dynamics sampling. Each city will have 2-person vegetation, water flux, and
            bird/insect sampling teams (these teams will also share soil sampling). Vegetation teams will include a
            trained botanist and bird/insect teams will included a trained birder. A postdoctoral associate, graduate
            student research associate, or technician will oversee teams in each city, coordinating team efforts,
            providing quality control on protocols, managing personnel, and ensuring safety. This approach should
            minimize the number of trips required to all sites. Our planning allows for training, finalizing site locations,
            rainouts, and data entry. Sampling order of sites of different types will be blocked (i.e., we won’t sample
            all of one type of site sequentially) to avoid confounding with weather or seasonal patterns. Each team
            will funnel data to a central postdoctoral researcher/data manager.</p>

            <p>By combining broad-scale land-use change scenarios with 15
            finer-scale models of social drivers and ecological effects of yard management transitions, these
            scenarios will allow us to assess the relative contribution of these different scales of urban
            change to the future ecological structure of the American Residential Macrosystem.</p>
